## 1. Introduction to C Programming

C is a general-purpose programming language that provides low-level access to memory and system resources. It is widely used in system programming, embedded systems, and applications requiring high performance. Its efficiency and control make it a popular choice for developing operating systems, compilers, and other performance-critical applications.

### Key Features of C

- **Low-Level Access**: C allows manipulation of hardware resources through pointers and direct memory access.
- **Portability**: C programs can run on various platforms with minimal changes.
- **Rich Library Support**: The C standard library provides a wide range of functions for tasks such as input/output, string manipulation, and memory management.
- **Structured Programming**: C supports structured programming, which helps in organizing code into reusable functions.

## 2. Setting Up the Development Environment

To start programming in C, you need a development environment that includes:

- **Text Editor**: Use any text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or even Notepad) to write your code.
- **C Compiler**: Install a compiler like GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or Clang. These compilers convert your C code into executable programs.

### Installation Steps

1. **For Windows**:
   - Install MinGW or TDM-GCC to get the GCC compiler.
   - Set up the PATH environment variable to include the bin directory of your compiler.

2. **For macOS**:
   - Install Xcode from the App Store, which includes the Clang compiler.
   - Alternatively, install Homebrew and use it to install GCC: `brew install gcc`.

3. **For Linux**:
   - Most distributions come with GCC pre-installed. If not, you can install it using your package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install gcc` for Debian-based systems).

## 3. Basic Structure of a C Program

A C program consists of one or more functions, with the `main()` function being the entry point. Hereâ€™s the basic structure:

```c
#include <stdio.h> // Preprocessor directive

// Function declaration
void greet(); 

// Main function
int main() {
    greet(); // Function call
    return 0; // Return statement
}

// Function definition
void greet() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
}

### Explanation:

- **Preprocessor Directive**: `#include <stdio.h>` includes the standard input/output library, allowing the use of functions like `printf()`.
- **Function Declaration**: Declares the function `greet()` before its definition.
- **Main Function**: The execution starts here. It returns an integer to the operating system.
- **Function Definition**: Defines what the `greet()` function does.

## 4. Variables and Data Types

Variables are used to store data in a program. Each variable has a data type that defines the kind of data it can hold.

### Common Data Types

- **int**: Integer type (e.g., `-1`, `0`, `42`)
- **float**: Floating-point type for decimal numbers (e.g., `3.14`, `-0.001`)
- **double**: Double-precision floating-point type (more precision than `float`)
- **char**: Character type (e.g., `'a'`, `'Z'`)

### Variable Declaration and Initialization

```c
int age = 25;         // Declaration and initialization
float pi = 3.14159;  // Float variable
char initial = 'J';   // Character variable
```

### Constants

Constants are fixed values that cannot be altered during program execution. You can define them using the `const` keyword:

```c
const float GRAVITY = 9.81; // Constant for gravity
```

## 5. Control Structures

Control structures dictate the flow of execution in a program. They include conditional statements and loops.

### If-Else Statements

The `if` statement executes a block of code if a condition is true; otherwise, it executes an optional `else` block.

```c
int num = 10;

if (num > 0) {
    printf("Positive number\n");
} else {
    printf("Non-positive number\n");
}
```

### Switch Statements

The `switch` statement allows multi-way branching based on the value of an expression.

```c
int day = 3;

switch (day) {
    case 1:
        printf("Monday\n");
        break;
    case 2:
        printf("Tuesday\n");
        break;
    case 3:
        printf("Wednesday\n");
        break;
    default:
        printf("Invalid day\n");
}
```

### Loops

Loops allow code to be executed repeatedly based on a condition.

#### For Loop

```c
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    printf("%d ", i); // Outputs: 0 1 2 3 4
}
```

#### While Loop

```c
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    printf("%d ", i);
    i++;
}
```

#### Do-While Loop

```c
int i = 0;
do {
    printf("%d ", i);
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
```

## 6. Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They can take parameters and return values.

### Function Declaration and Definition

```c
int add(int a, int b); // Function declaration

int main() {
    int result = add(5, 3); // Function call
    printf("%d\n", result); // Output: 8
    return 0;
}

// Function definition
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b; // Return the sum
}
```

### Function Parameters

Functions can take multiple parameters, allowing you to pass data into them.

```c
void printSum(int a, int b) {
    printf("Sum: %d\n", a + b);
}
```

## 7. Arrays

Arrays are collections of variables of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations.

### Declaring and Initializing Arrays

```c
int numbers; // Declaration of an array
int primes = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11}; // Initialization
```

### Accessing Array Elements

Array elements are accessed using their index:

```c
printf("%d\n", primes); // Output: 5
```

### Multi-Dimensional Arrays

You can create arrays with more than one dimension:

```c
int matrix = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}};
printf("%d\n", matrix); // Output: 6
```

## 8. Pointers

Pointers are variables that store memory addresses. They are a powerful feature of C, allowing for dynamic memory management and efficient array handling.

### Pointer Basics

To declare a pointer, use the `*` operator:

```c
int *ptr; // Pointer to an integer
```

### Assigning Addresses to Pointers

You can assign the address of a variable to a pointer using the `&` operator:

```c
int x = 42;
ptr = &x; // ptr now holds the address of x
```

### Dereferencing Pointers

To access the value stored at the address a pointer points to, use the `*` operator:

```c
printf("%d\n", *ptr); // Output: 42
```

### Pointer Arithmetic

Pointers can be incremented or decremented. When you increment a pointer, it moves to the next memory address based on the data type size.

```c
int arr[] = {10, 20, 30};
int *p = arr; // p points to the first element of arr
printf("%d\n", *p); // Output: 10
p++; // Move to the next integer
printf("%d\n", *p); // Output: 20
```

### Pointers and Arrays

In C, arrays and pointers are closely related. The name of an array acts as a pointer to its first element.

```c
int arr = {1, 2, 3};
int *p = arr; // p points to the first element of arr
printf("%d\n", *(p + 1)); // Output: 2
```

### Dynamic Memory Allocation

C provides functions for dynamic memory allocation, allowing you to allocate memory at runtime.

#### Using `malloc()`

```c
int *arr = (int *)malloc(5 * sizeof(int)); // Allocate memory for 5 integers
if (arr == NULL) {
    printf("Memory allocation failed\n");
}
```

#### Freeing Memory

Always free dynamically allocated memory to avoid memory leaks:

```c
free(arr); // Deallocate memory
```
